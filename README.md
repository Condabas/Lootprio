# MasterLoot

## Easy way to assign loot as ML

A new Addon imported from TBC & fully redesigned & optimized.

[LootBlare](https://github.com/MarcelineVQ/LootBlare) The sister addon to makes it easier to see loot rolls for the players.

**This  Addon isnt compatible with AddOns changing UI of Default LootFrame like Skinning of Pfui, Xloot...**

*Command in game Available :*
> /xckmla Rand

This will make a Raid Random Player, like when you want give a Onyxia bag to random Guy

> /loot

This will open the options settings window. Recommend making a macro button for this so you don't have to wait to loot something in order to be able to configure addon. 

## Main Funcs of this Addon :

2 Methods available -> (+1 Need(MS) / +2 Greed(OS)) & ***Roll***

This addon has been configured to be used by a LC loot system using the ***Roll*** method. 

The lootprio.lua file has all the prios for each item and who can roll. When an item drops that matches an item on the list, the text box will auto populate the prio text. All the master looter has to do is click the dice button to announce the prio for the item in Raid Warning. 

If an item hasn't been decided on during an LC meeting, it could have "LC" prio assigned to it. If only "LC" is in the text window, and hit the dice button, it will send a message with a link of the item to the officers channel for input on what should be done with the item. 

**All is configurable**<br />

You can set a Disenchanter, a Banker, a guy for grey & White items, a guy for all Raids items like Idols, Coins, Elementium, Lavacore etc

You can set AutoLoot for Trash & Raids item guys by checking the AL box.

You can Change the quality of items displayed on Roll Window from Poor to Legendary.
